Team: noname.cpp- Nandini Mawane, Shlok Desai

### Project files:
1. noname_main.py - Contains the user interface and function calls. (main file)

2. noname_watchlist.py - This contains class methods that will take the input from the files, and call the pattern file functions on that data. It also has the functions that will create the output file.

3. noname_patterns.py - This contains the functions to determine whether a pattern exists in the data passed. The functions return the pattern name if the particular pattern is found, else it returns None.

4. noname_user_stock.py - This file contains the functions invoked when a user chooses to input his own stock data.

5. Files ending with "input_data.txt" are the one month long stock data containing the particular stock's open, low, high, close, date.

Contributions have been mentioned at the start of the main file i.e. noname_main.py
